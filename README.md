# A Graph-Based Neural Model for End-to-End Frame Semantic Parsing

We will release our codes for EMNLP2021 paper "A Graph-Based Neural Model for End-to-End Frame Semantic Parsing" very soon.

## TODOs:
- [ ] An easy-to-use pipeline models for specific usages (will be published recently)
- [ ] An easy-to-use full joint model for extracting frame-semantic structures (will be published recently)
